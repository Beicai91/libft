# Libft
libft is a **custom C library** that reimplements a collection of standard functions from `<string.h>`, `<ctype.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and other common headers. It also includes additional utility functions for **memory management**, **string processing**, **linked lists**, and general-purpose programming. The goal is to build a solid, reusable foundation for future 42 projects.
